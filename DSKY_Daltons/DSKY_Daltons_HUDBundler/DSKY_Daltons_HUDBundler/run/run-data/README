run-data and platform file rules
--------------------------------

This directory contains the data, initial condition files, bitmaps, etc
that you need for running your application. Some hints for what data
to put where:

    * Configuration files, data, etc. *specific to one project only*
      goes in the run/run-data folder
    * Data that can be shared with other projects (3D models, bitmaps
      etc, common configuration for e.g. hardware devices) is best
      kept in a 'module' directory. Either together with module code
      (such as for glade files matching a certain experiment interface)
      or separately (e.g. visual terrain data). If you remove the
      comm-objects.lst and Makefile from a module directory, it is treated
      as a pseudo-module, and not included for compilation and you can
      keep data there.
    * Log data should not be checked in with the project.
    * The run directories, under run/<platform>/node, only contain
      - project configuration; dueca.cnf/dueca.mod, or
        dueca_cnf.py/dueca_mod.py
      - links.script and clean.script, which create links to all
        appropriate data
